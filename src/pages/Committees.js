            Committees (Swedish: nämnder) are groups inside the chapter that dedicate themselves to some part of chapter life, such as
            student overall culture, sports, chapter management, parties, etc. They are most important and as such we describe the committees of
            the Computer Science (CS) and Media Technology here.
            Some committees are shared between the computer Science and Media Technology chapters and are listed below. Others are
            chapter-specific, so CS's Study Board is not the same committee as Media's Study Board.

            exchange students (you need to be here for more than 6 months)! Media students may also apply for the course, with
            their master coordinator's approval.
